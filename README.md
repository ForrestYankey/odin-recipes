# odin-recipes
First Odin project. Recipe website.

In this project I will be using the skills I have learned from the HTML unit of the Odin Project.

Some of those skills are:
	- Setting up a Git repository and cloning it to my computer.
	- Using the command line to create files and directories. 
	- Creating html files and using VSCode to write in them.
	- Using different elements to create a webpage.
